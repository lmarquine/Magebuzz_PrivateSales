## Features
* Overview
Buying and selling through private sales systems has gained momentum as a recent E-commerce trend. Bringing big discounts on bulk purchases and brand-name goods, registered 'members' can take advantage of systems like these for great prices, and as a business owner you can take advantage of this tool too. Our Private Sales module enables you to create a network of loyal customers who will feel they are being treated to special deals and opportunities, while giving you a way to sell discounted products to only loyal shoppers. 


* A Private catalog limited to specific customer groups
Your administrators, after installation of this module, can setup special customer groups to view these limited products and categories. You can even create a VIP area of luxury or extremely rare products, and a normal section from which everyone else can purchase from. This gives you the flexibility to offer to customers only what their customer level has indicated they are likely to buy. 


* Sales Events
Hosting sales and other buying incentive event options are easily done by creating a banner and time counter with the event and will be shown only in that category or product page. You can also set the specific visibility of sales, giving only certain user groups access to these sales. In conjunction with the Promotions feature of Magento, this is a great way for you to attract and maintain more loyal customers. 


* Force users to login
This is a basic feature of a Private Sales system. By enabling this feature, customers can only access your store after logging in. This feature can be turned on and off for the whole store, or only certain catalog or product pages. 


* Invite more customers
Private Sales allows each group of customers to invite a specific number of their friends, based on admin settings, and and admin can also send an invitation email to new customers in the backend. You can also enable a sign-up invitation code to allow only invited people to your system.
